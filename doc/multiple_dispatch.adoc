## Multiple Dispatch

A method can have more than one `virtual_ptr` parameter. For example:

[source,c++]
----
include::{exampledir}/hello_world.cpp[tag=multi]
----

[source,c++]
----
include::{exampledir}/hello_world.cpp[tag=multi_call,indent=0]
----

The appropriate overrider is selected using a process similar to overload
resolution, with fallback options. If one overrider is more specialized than all
the others, call it. Otherwise, the return type is used as a tie-breaker, _if_
it is covariant with the return type of the base method. If there is still no
unique best overrider, one of the best overriders is chosen arbitrarily.
