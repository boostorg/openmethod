## Overview

### Requirements

OpenMethod requires C++17 or above. It depends on the following Boost libraries:

* Assert
* Config
* Core
* DynamicBitset
* Mp11
* Preprocessor

Boost.Test is also required to build and run the unit tests.

### Installation

The library is headers-only. You can install it system-wide, or add the path to
the `include` directory to your project's include path.

### Namespaces

#### boost::openmethod

The library's main namespace. Contains `method`, `virtual_ptr` and
`virtual_ptr_traits`, `use_classes`, the `debug` and `release` policies, etc.

#### boost::openmethod::policies

Contains the policy classes and their facets.

### Headers

#### <boost/openmethod/core.hpp>

The library's main header. Contains `method`, `virtual_ptr` and
`virtual_ptr_traits`, `use_classes`, the `debug` and `release` policies, etc.

#### <boost/openmethod/compiler.hpp>

Defines `intialize` and `finalize`, which are used to register classes and

#### <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>

#### <boost/openmethod.hpp>

#### <boost/openmethod/policies.hpp>

#### <boost/openmethod/shared_ptr.hpp>

#### <boost/openmethod/unique_.hpp>

#### <boost/openmethod/with_vptr.hpp>
