## vptr

### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/policies/basic_policy.hpp>.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod::policies {

struct vptr {};

}
```

### Description

`vptr` is a facet that obtains a pointer to the v-table for an object.

OpenMethod implements method dispatch in a way similar to native virtual
function dispatch: for each virtual argument, fetch a pointer to the dispatch
data (known as the v-table), and use it to select a pointer to a function.
OpenMethod v-tables contain pointers to functions for unary methods, and, for
multi-methods, pointers to, and coordinates in, a multi-dimensional table of
pointers to functions.

The `vptr` facet is used during method call to fetch the vptr for virtual
arguments corresponding to the `virtual_` parameters in the method
declaration. It is also used by the constructor of `virtual_ptr` to obtain a
vptr on the basis of an object's dynamic type.

`virtual_ptr::final`, and the related convenience functions, assume that the
static and dynamic types of their argument are the same. The vptr is obtained
statically from the policy's `static_vptr<Class>` member. It is conceivable
to organize an entire program around the "final" constructs; thus, the `vptr`
facet is optional.

### Requirements

#### dynamic_vptr;

```c++
template<class Class>
static auto dynamic_vptr(const Class& obj) -> const vptr_type&;
```

Returns a pointer to the v-table for `obj`.

NOTE: `dynamic_vptr` _must_ return a reference to the pointer, not a value. This
is required for indirect `virtual_ptr`{empty}s.

## extern_vptr

### Synopsis

```c++
struct extern_vptr : virtual vptr {};
```

### Description

`extern_vptr` is a specialization of `vptr` that stores vptrs outside of the
objects.

### Requirements

The requirements of `vptr`, plus the following.

#### register_vptrs

```c++
template<typename ForwardIterator>
auto register_vptrs(ForwardIterator first, ForwardIterator last) -> void;
```

`ForwardIterator` is a forward iterator over a range of objects that contain
information about the type ids and the vptr of a registered class. They have the
following member functions:

```c++
auto type_id_begin() const -> type_id_forward_iterator;
auto type_id_end() const -> type_id_forward_iterator;
auto vptr() const -> const vptr_type&;
```

`type_id_begin` and `type_id_end` return iterators delimiting a range of
`type_id`s for the class.

`vptr` returns a _reference_ to a _static_ variable containing a pointer to the
v-table for a registered class. Its value is set by `initialize`. While the
value of the variable changes with each call to `initialize`, the variable
itself remains the same.

## indirect_vptr

### Synopsis

```c++
struct indirect_vptr {};
```

### Description

`indirect_vptr` is a facet that makes `virtual_ptr`{empty}s and `with_vptr` use
pointers to pointers to v-tables, instead of straight pointers. As a
consequence, they remain valid after a call to `initialize`.

### Requirements

None. The facet is its own implementation.
