### Headers

Defined in <boost/openmethod/policies/basic_policy.hpp>. Also available via
`<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>` and `<boost/openmethod.hpp>`.

### Description

`basic_policy` implements a policy, which consists of a a collection of methods,
classes, dispatch data, and facets, which specify how to obtain a pointer to a
v-table from an object, how to report errors, whether to perform runtime sanity
checks, etc.

`basic_policy` has state. It uses the Curiously Recurring Template Pattern to
allow distinct policies to have distinct sets of static variables.

### Members

#### has

```c++
template<class Facet>
static constexpr bool has;
```

Evaluates to `true` if _Policy_ contains _Facet_.

#### fork

```c++
template<class NewPolicy>
using fork;
```

Creates a new policy from an existing one. _NewPolicy_ does not share static
variables with the original _Policy_. The new policy does not retain any
knowledge of the classes and methods registered in the original.

`fork` forks the facets in the policy as well: any facet instantiated from a
class template is assumed to take a policy as its first template argument. The
template is re-instantiated with the new policy as the first arguments, while
the other arguments remain the same.

#### with

```c++
template<class... Facets>
using with;
```

Requires:: _Facets_ is a list of classes that derive from `facet`.

Returns:: A new policy containing _Facets_, and the facets from the original
that do not have the same category as _Facets_.

Examples::
* `struct dyn_load : default_registry::fork<dyn_load>::with<indirect_vptr> {};` +
  Creates a policy just like `default_registry`, with an extra indirection added
  to the v-table pointers. This policy is suitable for use with dynamic loading.
* `struct release_with_diags : release::fork<release_with_diags>::with<basic_error_output<release_with_diags>> {};` +
  Creates a policy just like `release`, except that it prints a diagnostic
  message before terminating with `abort()`.
* `struct default_throw : default_registry::fork<default_throw>::with<throw_error_handler> {};` +
  Creates a policy just like `default_registry`, except that it reports errors by
  throwing exceptions, instead of calling a `std::function` like the default
  error handler does.

#### without

```c++
template<class... Facets>
using without;
```

Requires:: _Facets_ is a list of facet categories.

Returns:: A new policy containing the facets from the original that do not have
the same category as _Facets_.

Examples::
* `struct use_map : default_registry::fork<use_map>::with<vptr_map<use_map>>::without<type_hash> {};` +
  Creates a policy just like `default_registry`, except that it stores pointers to
  v-table in a `std::unordered_map`. Also removes the hash function, since it
  will not be used.

### Non-members

#### release

```c++
struct release;
```

A policy that contains facets `std_rtti`, `fast_perfect_hash`, `vptr_vector` and
`vectored_error_handler`.

#### debug

```c++
struct debug;
```

The `release` policy with additional facet implementations `runtime_checks`,
`basic_error_output` and basic_trace_output.

NOTE: `debug` extends `release` but it does not a fork it. Both policies use the
same `domain`.

#### default_registry

An alias for `release` if `NDEBUG` is defined, and for `debug` otherwise.
