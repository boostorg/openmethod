## Friendship

We can use overrider containers to grant friendship to a specific overrider, or
to all the overriders of a method. The name of the container template is
returned by `BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS`. The template argument for a
specialization is the signature of the overrider. For example, the overrider of
`poke` for `Cat` is:

[source,c++]
----
BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(poke)<
    void(std::ostream& os, virtual_ptr<Cat> cat)>::fn;
----

We can thus grant friendship to all the overriders of `poke`:

[source,c++]
----
include::{examplesdir}/friendship.cpp[tag=friend_all]
----

Be aware, though, that the overriders of _any_ method called `poke` - with any
signature - are granted friendship.

We can also befriendto individual overriders:

[source,c++]
----
include::{examplesdir}/friendship.cpp[tag=friend]
----
