Default value for Registry

== Synopsis

Defined in `&lt;https://www.github.com/boostorg/openmethod/blob/develop/include/boost/openmethod/core.hpp#L27[boost&sol;openmethod&sol;core&period;hpp]&gt;`

```cpp
#define BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY ::boost::openmethod::default_registry
```

== Description

The name of the default registry.

`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` is the default value for the `Registry`
template parameter of cpp:method[], cpp:use_classes[], cpp:virtual_ptr[], and
all the constructs that take a registry as a template argument.

`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` can be defined by a program to change the
default registry globally, *before* including `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>`. After that, changing its value has no effect, even on other macros.

To override the default registry, proceed as follows:

1. Define a cpp:registry[] class, either from scratch, or by tuning an existing
registry. Include `<boost/openmethod/preamble.hpp>`,
`<boost/openmethod/default_registry.hpp>`, and headers under
`boost/openmethod/policies` as needed.

2. Set `BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` to the new registry class.

3. Include `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>`.

NOTE;; Use this feature with caution, as it will cause ODR violations if
different translation units define different default registries.
