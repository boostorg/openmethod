= BOOST_OPENMETHOD

### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>.

```c++
BOOST_OPENMETHOD(ID, (PARAMETERS...), RETURN_TYPE [, REGISTRY]);
```

### Description

Declares a method, called `ID`, with the given `PARAMETERS` and `RETURN_TYPE`,
and adds it to `REGISTRY`.

`PARAMETERS` is a comma-separated list of types, possibly followed by parameter
names, just like in a function declaration. Parameters with a type in the form
`virtual_ptr<T>` or `virtual_<T>` are called virtual parameters. The dynamic
type of the arguments passed in virtual parameters determines which overrider to
call, following the same rules as overloaded function resolution:

1. Form the set of all applicable overriders. An overrider is applicable
   if it can be called with the arguments passed to the method.
2. If the set is empty, call the error handler (if present in the
   registry), then terminate the program with `abort`.
3. Remove the overriders that are dominated by other overriders in the
   set. Overrider A dominates overrider B if any of its virtual formal
   parameters is more specialized than B's, and if none of B's virtual
   parameters is more specialized than A's.
4. If the resulting set contains exactly one overrider, call it.

If a single most specialized overrider does not exist, the program is
terminated via `abort`. If the registry contains an `error_handler`
policy, its `error` function is called with an object that describes the
error, prior calling `abort`. `error` may prevent termination by throwing an
exception.

[]

For each virtual argument `arg`, the dispatch mechanism calls
`virtual_traits::peek(arg)` and deduces the v-table pointer from the
`result`, using the first of the following methods that applies:

1. If `result` is a `virtual_ptr`, get the pointer to the v-table from it.
2. If `boost_openmethod_vptr` can be called with `result` and a `Registry*`,
   and it returns a `vptr_type`, call it.
3. Call `Registry::rtti::dynamic_vptr(result)`.


The macro creates an ordinary inline function in the current scope, with the
`virtual_` decorators removed from the parameter types. `virtual_ptr`{empty}s
are preserved.

NOTE: `ID` must be an *identifier*. Qualified names are not allowed.

NOTE: The default value for `REGISTRY` is the value of
`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_REGISTRY` at the point `<boost/openmethod/core.hpp>` is
included. Changing the value of this symbol has no effect after that point.

### Implementation Notes

The macro creates several additional constructs:

* A `struct` forward declaration that acts as the method's identifier:

```c++
struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(ID);
```

* A class template declaration that acts as a container for the method's
overriders in the current scope:

```c++
template<typename...> struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(NAME);
```

* A _guide_ function used to match overriders with the method:

```c++
auto BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(ID)_guide(...)
    -> ::boost::openmethod::method<
        BOOST_OPENMETHOD_ID(ID)(PARAMETERS...), RETURN_TYPE [, REGISTRY]>;
```

* A xref:BOOST_OPENMETHOD_REGISTER.adoc[registrar] that adds the method to the
registry.
