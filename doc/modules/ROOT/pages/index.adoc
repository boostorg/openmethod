= Boost.OpenMethod

Boost.OpenMethod implements open-(multi-)methods in C++17 and above.

== Features

* Single dispatch can be as fast as equivalent virtual function calls.

* Multiple dispatch in constant time (for a given number of virtual parameters).

* Redundancy-free multiple dispatch tables.

* Inter-operation with standard smart pointers, extensible to other pointer-like
  types.

* Exception agnostic by default.

* Macro-based interface for convenience.

* Macro-free interface for inter-operation with templates.

* Customization points for alternative RTTI systems, error handling, vptr
  placement, etc.

* Headers-only.

== Requirements

The library requires an optimizing compiler supporting C++17 or above.

== Tested Compilers

Boost.OpenMethod is tested with the following compilers:

* clang: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

* gcc: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15

* msvc: 14.3

* icpx

and on the following platforms:

* Linux

* macOS

* Windows

* s390x

== Quality Assurance

The development infrastructure for the library includes these per-commit
analyses:

* Coverage reports

* Clang sanitizers

* Compilation and tests on Drone.io and GitHub Actions

== Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the C++ Alliance for their support, in particular
Joaquín M. López Muñoz for encouraging me to submit my library and being the
first to endorse it; and Dmitryi Arkhipov for volunteering to be the review
manager.
