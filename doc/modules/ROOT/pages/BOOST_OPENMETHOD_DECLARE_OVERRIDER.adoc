## BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER

### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>.

```c++
#define BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER(NAME, (PARAMETERS...), RETURN_TYPE)
```

### Description

Declare an overrider for a method.

The method is deduced from a call to a method guide function with the
overrider's arguments.

The macro creates several entities in the current scope.

* A class template that acts as a container for the overriders of the methods
called `NAME`:

```c++
template<typename...> BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(NAME);
```

* A specialization of the container template for the overrider:

```c++
struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(NAME)<RETURN_TYPE(PARAMETERS...)> {
    static auto fn(PARAMETERS...) -> RETURN_TYPE;
    static auto has_next() -> bool;
    template<typename... Args>
    static auto next(typename... Args) -> RETURN_TYPE;
};
```

where:

* `fn` is the overrider function.

* `has_next()` returns `true` if a less specialized overrider exists.

* `next(Args... args)` calls the next most specialized overrider via the
pointer stored in the method's `next<fn>` member variable.

`BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER` can be called in a header file, with a
semicolon after the call. It can be called in a header file, but not multiple
times in the same translation unit.

NOTE: `NAME` must be an *identifier*. Qualified names are not allowed.
