## BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER

### Synopsis

Defined in <boost/openmethod/macros.hpp>.

```c++
#define BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DECLARE_OVERRIDER(NAME, (PARAMETERS...), RETURN_TYPE)
```

### Description

Declares an overrider for a method, but does not start its definition. This
macro can be used in header files.

`ID` is the identifier of the method to which the overrider is added.

NOTE: `ID` must be an *identifier*. Qualified names are not allowed.

`PARAMETERS` is a comma-separated list of types, possibly followed by parameter
names, just like in a function declaration.

The macro tries to locate a method that can be called with the same argument
list as the overrider, possibly via argument dependent lookup.

Each `virtual_ptr<T>` in the method's parameter list must have a corresponding
`virtual_ptr<U>` parameter in the same position in the overrider's parameter
list, such that `U` is the same as `T`, or has `T` as an accessible unambiguous
base.

Each `virtual_<T>` in the method's parameter list must have a corresponding `U`
parameter in the same position in the overrider's parameter list, such that `U`
is the same as `T`, or has `T` as an accessible unambiguous base.

### Implementation Notes

The macro creates additional entities in the current scope.

* A class template declaration that acts as a container for the method's
overriders in the current scope:

```c++
template<typename...> struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(NAME);
```

* A specialization of the container for the overrider:
+
--
```c++
struct BOOST_OPENMETHOD_OVERRIDERS(ID)<RETURN_TYPE(PARAMETERS...)> {
    static auto fn(PARAMETERS...) -> RETURN_TYPE;
    static auto has_next() -> bool;
    template<typename... Args>
    static auto next(typename... Args) -> RETURN_TYPE;
};
```
