## RestrictedOutputStream

### Description

RestrictedOutputStream is a concept describing a `std::ostream`-like class with
a reduced set of operations.

While convenient, `std::ostream` and its implementations constitute a sizeable
piece of code, which may make it unsuitable for certain applications. OpenMethod
uses a small subset of the operations supported by `std::ostream`. By default,
the library uses a lightweight implementation based on the C stream functions.

Implementations of `RestrictedOutputStream` provide the following functions:

[cols="a,a", options="header"]
