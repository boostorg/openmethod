## initialize

### Synopsis

Defined in `<boost/openmethod/compiler.hpp>`.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod {

template<class Policy = BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_POLICY>
auto compiler<Policy>::initialize() -> /*unspecified*/;

}
```

### Description

Initializes dispatch data for the methods registered in `Policy`. This function
must be called before any calls to those methods, and after loading or unloading
a dynamic library that adds classes, methods or overriders to `Policy`.

## finalize

### Synopsis

Defined in `<boost/openmethod/compiler.hpp>`.

```c++
namespace boost::openmethod {

template<class Policy = BOOST_OPENMETHOD_DEFAULT_POLICY>
auto finalize() -> void;

}
```

### Description

De-allocates the resources allocated by `initialize` for the `Policy`, including
resources allocated by the facets in `Policy`. Resources are de-allocated in an
arbitrary order. It is not necessary to call `finalize` between calls to
`initialize`. It is provided mainly for the benefit of memory leak detection
schemes.
